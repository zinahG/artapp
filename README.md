# üé® Art Gallery and Marketplace Web Application

## Abstract
Due to the lack of fine art galleries and creative exhibits, artists in this country are severely constrained in how, when, and where they can sell and exhibit their work.  
This project is a **Node.js web application** that connects artists with art enthusiasts, enabling them to:
- Showcase and sell their artwork online
- Reach a wider audience
- Allow customers to browse, discover, and purchase artworks

**Features:**
- Artists can create profiles, upload and manage their artworks
- Customers can browse artworks, add them to a cart, and checkout
- Admin can manage artworks and remove non-original content
